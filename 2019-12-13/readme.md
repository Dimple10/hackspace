## Analyzing Ly-a data to constrain nCDM

This was the last meeting of the semester. We went forward in analyzing the Lyman-alpha data from [Chabanier et al 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08103.pdf) (which is now in data directory), in order to fit a "alpha, beta, gamma" model for non-cold dark matter, as presented in [Murgia et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08371). We will come back to this analysis in the new semester, with a goal to write up our results---limits on non-cold dark matter from Lyman-alpha data---in a paper form. We have also discovered that the [data from Murgia et al 2018](http://adlibitum.oats.inaf.it/XQ100survey/Data.html) are also available, so we will be able to directly check their results.


Suggested exercises: 
- check out lyman_alpha.ipynb in notebooks
- repeat Likelihod analysis on Murgia et al 2018 data.
