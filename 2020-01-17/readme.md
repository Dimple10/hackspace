## Analyzing Ly-a data to constrain nCDM

We are continuing to analyze the Lyman-alpha data from [Chabanier et al 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08103.pdf) (in data directory), in order to fit a "alpha, beta, gamma" model for non-cold dark matter, as presented in [Murgia et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08371). Our goal is to write up our results---limits on non-cold dark matter from Lyman-alpha data---in a paper form. We have also discovered that the [data from Murgia et al 2018](http://adlibitum.oats.inaf.it/XQ100survey/Data.html) are also available, so we will be able to directly check their results.

This time, we have set up a lya directory in usc-cosmolab-hackspace and everyone made their own fork of it and cloned it into its own directory on their computer. We will collaboratively be adding code to lya and making pull requests to the main hackspace.
