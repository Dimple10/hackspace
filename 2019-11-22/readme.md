# CosmoLab meeting: 11/22/19

Attending: Vera Gluscevic, Tim Morton, Siavash Yasini, Karime Maamari, Aryan Rahimieh, Remy Gerras, Sydney Feldman, Javier Zhao, Chris Lindsay, David Liu, Jack Lashner, Connor Powers, Jason Williams, Nareg Mirzatuny. 


## Bayesian inference
Tim presented theoretical foundation of Bayesian inference; we talked about Likelihood, Priors, and Posterior probability distribution; we lighlty touched on what it means to sample the posterior, what confidence-level intervals are, and what is parameter space; we drew a distinction between a physical model and a generative (statistical) model.


Suggested exercises: 
- Plot Cl for several different ini files
- Try to tweak cosmological parameters in explanatory.ini to get  P(k) that goes through our data points (the Lyamn-alpha measurements we've been playing with)
