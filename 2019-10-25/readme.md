# CosmoLab meeting: 10/25/19

Attending: Vera Gluscevic, Tim Morton, Siavash Yasini, Javier Zhao, Sidney Feldman, Aryan Rahimieh, Jack Lashner, Isabella Johansson, Karime Maamari, Elena Pierpaoli.

By the end of this meeting, you should be able to

* Create a repository on github and add collaborators
* Use the following commands fluently:
  * `git clone`
  * `git pull`
  * `git commit`
  * `git push`
* Read in and plot data from a file

## Hands-on CosmoLab goal for fall 2019

For the rest of the semester, we'll be developing coding/research tools with a practical goal in mind: look for evidence of dark matter interactions in Lyman-alpha data.

Useful papers:

[Matter power spectrum: from LyÎ± forest to CMB scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08103)

[Novel constraints on non-cold (non-thermal) Dark Matter from Lyman-alpha forest data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08371)

[Cosmological Probes of Dark Matter Interactions: The Next Decade](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05140)


## Exercise (intro to using git and visualizing data)

1. Create a new 'cosmolab-scratchwork' repository via GitHub (name it whatever you want),
and add `veragluscevic` and `timothydmorton` as collaborators on this repo.
Initialize with a README, choose 'python' from the .gitignore options, and MIT
license.
2. Clone this new repo to your machine.
3. Edit the readme file, commit and push the changes (play around with [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)!).  See this on GitHub!
4. Clone `https://github.com/veragluscevic/usc-cosmolab-hackspace` to your machine.
5. From within your new repo, make a jupyter notebook and use it to ingest
and visualize the lyman-alpha data from the usc-cosmolab repo (`data/lyman-alpha.txt`).
6. Commit and push your notebook as you make changes.
