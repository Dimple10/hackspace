# CosmoLab meeting: 11/08/19

Attending: Vera Gluscevic, Tim Morton, Siavash Yasini, Aryan Rahimieh, Karime Maamari, Remy Gerras, Sydney Feldman, Javier Zhao, Chris Lindsay, David Liu, Jack Lashner, Connor Powers. 


## More on fitting a model

We went over basics of running CLASS; if you'd like, try making plots of Cl's and Pk's for different cosmological parameters (play with explanatory.ini file, change \Omega_b, for example). Karime briefly discussed Makefile, what it is and how to use it. Siavash talked about the CMB, Cls, CMB maps, spherical harmonics, and cosmic variance. His notebook is here. Tim then introduced the notion of likelihood function (bow and arrows example). 

Suggested exercises: 
- Plot Cl for several different ini files
- Try to tweak cosmological parameters in explanatory.ini to get  P(k) that goes through our data points (the Lyamn-alpha measurements we've been playing with)
