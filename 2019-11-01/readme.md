# CosmoLab meeting: 11/01/19

Attending: Vera Gluscevic, Tim Morton, Aryan Rahimieh, Isabella Johansson, Karime Maamari, Sydney Feldman, Javier Zhao, Chris Lindsay, David Liu, Jack Lashner, Connor Powers, Jason Williams. 


## Brief history of the Universe

Dr. Gluscevic gave a brief intro to general cosmology, covering the following questions: How did structure form? What is matter power spectrum? We talked about the relationship between the linear Boltzmann codes (like CLASS) and numerical simulations of structure formation. In the next few weeks, we will use measurements of the linear matter power spectrum P(k) from Lyman-alpha data and fit them with P(k) output of CLASS. 

## Fitting a model to data

We started talking about fitting a model to data, on an example of generic data, but will move on to Lyman-alpha data soon; see [here](fitting_model.md). Solutions to this are here.
